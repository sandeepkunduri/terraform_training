# Lab: Migrate Variables to Terraform Enterprise

Duration: 15 minutes

This lab demonstrates how to store variables to Terraform Enterprise.

- Task 1: Create a Terraform Cloud user token
- Task 2: Create a configuration which stores its state on Terraform Cloud
- Task 3: Create another Terraform config that reads from the state on Terraform Cloud

## Prerequisites

For this lab, we'll assume that you've installed [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and that you have [signed up](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account) for a Terraform Cloud account and have completed the `remote-state` and `read-state` labs.

## Task: Update Terraform Code to use variables and store them within Terraform Cloud.

Now that we have our state stored in Terraform Cloud in our `server-build` workspace, we will take the next logical step and store our sensitive variables into TFC as well.

### Step 1.1.1:
Update the `main.tf` of the local project connected to our `server-build` workspace to utilize variable and store them in TFC.  Add the following `variable` blocks to your `main.tf`.

```hcl
variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}
variable "subnet_id" {}
variable "identity" {}
variable "vpc_security_group_ids" {
  type = list
}
variable "server_count" {
  type = number
}
```

Update you `main.tf` to utilize the variables you have declared in the variable blocks above.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region     = var.region
}

module "server" {
  source = "./server"
  count                  = var.server_count
  subnet_id              = var.subnet_id
  vpc_security_group_ids = var.vpc_security_group_ids
  identity               = var.identity
  key_name               = module.keypair.key_name
  private_key            = module.keypair.private_key_pem
}
```

### Step 1.1.2

Set and define your variable values in the Variables section of the `server-build` workspace of Terraform Cloud.


Next reinitialize your terraform project locally and run a `terraform plan` to validate that refactoring your code to make use of variables within TFC did not introduce any planned infrastructure changes.  This can be confirmed by validating a zero change plan.

```bash
terraform plan

Running plan in the remote backend. Output will stream here. Pressing Ctrl-C
will stop streaming the logs, but will not stop the plan running remotely.

module.server[1].aws_instance.web[1]: Refreshing state... [id=i-03be3bf6ee29f5633]

No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

This means that Terraform did not detect any differences between your
configuration and real physical resources that exist. As a result, no
actions need to be performed.
```

### Step 1.1.3
After confirming a zero change plan, clean up the comments in your `main.tf` the reference the `Don't Delete these until instructed to`.

Modify the server count by changing the `server_count` variable in TFC and running a `terraform apply`.

### Step 1.1.4

Congratulations! You're now storing your variable definitions remotely and can control the behavior of your Terraform code by adjusting their values. With Terraform Cloud you are able to centralize and secure the variable definintions for your workspace.
